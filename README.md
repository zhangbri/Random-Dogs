# AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Brian Zhang**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Dog Generator** is an android app that fetches and displays random dog images from the Dog CEO API in a scrollable list. Users can view a variety of dog images and click on each image to receive a notification indicating the position of the clicked dog image in the list.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🐕‍🦺🐾🐶**

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient

- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [X] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [X] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`
